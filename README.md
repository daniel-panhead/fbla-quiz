## Take a quiz on your FBLA knowledge
The quiz app is built on Electron, React, and Typescript and uses MongoDB for storage.  
Electron provides for easy user interaction and cross-platform compatibility since it essentially serves a webpage inside a program.  
React allows for dynamic pages and Typescript streamlines the development process.  
Questions and user profiles are stored in a MongoDB database on the cloud.

All source/build files are located in src/.
